# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This calculator uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.

The returned dictionary follows this format:

{
  'mean': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'variance': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'standard deviation': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'max': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'min': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'sum': [axis1, axis2, flattened]
}

axis1 refers to columns, axis2 refers to rows, and flattened refers to the entire collection in 1 dimension.

If a list containing less than 9 elements is passed into the function, a ValueError exception is raised with the message: "List must contain nine numbers."
